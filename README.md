# Administative Inventory Manager

## Alx Final Project 

This Project is meant to showcase my understanding of frontend and backend technologies, my ability to learn a new  programming language, showcase my skill and to also have fun while doing so. 
The inventory manager incorporates both of these and is meant to serve as a useful tool to aid online store owners help manage their inventory without the need for any coding background. It is ony one small part of a much larger project which would entail building the main Ecommerce website and deploying it.

## Technology
* HTML and CSS - HTML provides web page structure, whereas CSS is mainly used to control web page styling 
* PHP was used to create website functionality and the management systems and more, it is a server side anguage that manages backend operations and server logic. It is a widely-used general-purpose language that can be embedded into HTML.It is used as the core programming language to handle all the core functions.
* XAMPP - PHP is a server side programming language and is not intended to be executed in a browser, therefore a web server (like Apache) retrieves our web page a preprocesses it for our web browser. This is where XAMPP comes in. It is used in order to run PHP scripts and manage our database. XAMPP can be downoaded using the link below
```sh
https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
```

## Installation
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/oshio-94/alx_final_project.git
```
Once XAMPP has been installed and the contents of the repositiory downloaded, run XAMPP and open the application folder. The contents of the repositiory are then placed in the htdocs folder which woud give the application access to our web pages and scripts.
